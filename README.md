- **Usage:** A minimal program to balance and redirect server requests.
- **Prevents single point of failure:** Ensures that SPoFs are eliminated in case of HTTP requests.
- **Custom domains:** The redirect URL can be fully customized.
- **Low complexity:** The application is relatively simple to understand and work with.
- **No limit on server URLs:** The number of proxy servers can be added single-handedly.
- **Improves overall reliability:** Improves the reliability of the network by efficient distribution of requests.

## Prerequisites

Golang core compiler has to be installed on the machine. Along with that, Golang CLI toolkit is necessary for compiling the source for the dependent architecture.

## Installation

Follow the steps in order to create an executable of your architecture:

- Fork and clone [this](https://github.com/sambhavsaxena/redirector) repository to make an instant copy of the content.
- Alternatively, you can download the source and set it up with Github Desktop.
- Open the root folder in the code editor of your preference, and run the following commands:

```
 go build
 go run main.go
```

This [file](https://github.com/sambhavsaxena/redirector/blob/main/golang-loadbalancer) is a pre-installed binary for my x86-64 Arch based distribution, and similar architectures.
